<h1 align = "center">Visualising Wind Power Potential in the UK</h1>

<p align = "center"><b>Overview</b>: This is a geospatial heatmap showcasing the wind speed (in km/h) at various locations across England in 2024. 
The heatmap visualises the intensity of wind speed at different wind turbine locations.</p>

## My Brief  

<i>The goal of this project is to explore advanced Python-based data visualisation libraries while addressing a subject I am deeply passionate about: renewable energy. Specifically, I aim to analyse the effectiveness of current wind farm locations in the UK, assessing whether these sites are optimally utilised. Additionally, I will investigate potential areas for new wind farm development, using data-driven insights to inform future decisions on sustainable energy deployment.</i>

  <h4><u>Python modules:</u><br/>Pandas, Streamlit, Folium</h4>
</p>

<h3><u>MVP</u> - Completed: 2025/03/16</h3>

- Basic small data sample of wind speed (last recorded end of 2024) for major cities in the UK 
- Functional basic dataframe visualisation of the sample dataset
- Functional geospatial map of the UK renders appropriately
- Basic Style Formatting

## Future Milestones

<h3><u>MS1</u></h3>

- Increasing the Dataset size; every major town/city within the UK and all wind speed information from 2024
- Utilising the data effectively; avg vs highest (visual toggle)
- An additional layer (toggle) to show the current wind farm locations 

<h3><u>MS2</u></h3>

- Increasing the Dataset scope: Locating data for villages, and offshore locations around the UK
- Increasing the Dataset size to account for more years for a more accurate prediction for the future wind conditions
- Implement a machine learning library (ie scikit) to aid future wind speed predictions
